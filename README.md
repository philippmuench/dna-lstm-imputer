# DNA sequence imputer

multi-layer Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM) for imputation of missing DNA fragments. This model was trained on a large collection of bacterial chromosomes. DNA imputer takes one DNA sequence seed as input and can predict the next amino acid character in a sequence. Furthermore, the RNN can then be used to generate amino acid character by character that will look like the original training data.
